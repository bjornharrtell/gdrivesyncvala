Client to sync Google Drive to local folder. Written using Vala.

Stuff that works:
* Google OAuth2 authentication (stored using GConf)
* Download Google Drive contents

Stuff that is TODO:
* Only download modified files
* Only download owned files (optional?)
* Upload new files
* Delete extraenous local files
* Configurable destination
* Run as daemon
* Optional status reporting using GNOME 3 Message Tray 

Currently the client is in a hacked state can can only do a simple download.
